# Scripty: Speech to Text for Discord!

Welcome to Scripty's GitHub repo! This repo contains the bot's entire source code.

# Scripty is discontinued forever!

Discord has made their platform absolute hell to work on. I personally cannot support a platform that thinks of devs in such a way that they're essentially disposable. No PRs or issues will be accepted for Scripty any more. If something breaks, I will not fix it. Deal with it or fix it yourself. If you try to contact me about something being broken, you'll be blocked. If you still need more of my reasoning behind this, go read Danny's gist: https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1.

## What is Scripty?

In a nutshell, Scripty is a speech to text bot for Discord voice chats.

## Invite the Bot

The bot is pretty much feature-complete and should be working... hopefully.

https://scripty.imaskeleton.me/invite

## Features/TODO

| Feature | Done |
| --- | --- |
| Audio Receive | yes |
| Audio Processing | yes |
| Speech To Text | yes ðŸŽ‰ |
| Send to Chat | yes |
| Database | yes |

## Self-hosting

No support for self-hosting will be given.

Building the bot requires Nightly Rust, with [`libdeepspeech.so`](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech) in your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` 
and `LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables.

You will also need to clone https://github.com/tazz4843/deepspeech-rs and
point `scripty_audio_utils/Cargo.toml` to the directory where you cloned it
(this fork adds forced implementations for Send + Sync on all types except one).
```bash
LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/libdeepspeech/" RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=native" cargo build --release
```

### It doesn't work on Windows!
Yeah I know. Windows support is not planned, nor will any PRs for it be accepted.
If you make one, it will be closed and **not** merged.

Most contributors disappear after a short time, leaving me to maintain everything.
I can't do that for multiple OSes, especially considering I have no Windows devices
to test on.
